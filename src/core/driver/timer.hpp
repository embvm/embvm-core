/** This class provides generic Timer interface definitions.
 *
 * The Timer class defines the common interfaces for Timer drivers. This class
 * can be inherited to provide specific Timer implementations.
 *
 * Timers can be used with the embvm::TimerManager<> class to provide software timer support.
 *
 * # Define a Timer driver
 *
 * To create a specialized Timer driver, derive from the Timer object:
 *
 * @code
 * class SimulatorTimer final : public timer::Timer
 * { ... };
 * @endcode
 *
 * Derived classes must implement the following interfaces:
 * - registerCallback()
 *
 * Derived classes must also implement pure virtual embvm::DriverBase functions:
 * - start_()
 * - stop_()
 *
 * The start_() function must implement the steps for starting the timer hardware.
 * The stop_() function is responsible for stopping the timer hardware.
 #
 # Note that the derived class will need to update the state variable according
 # to its current operational status.
 *
 * # Using a Timer driver
 *
 * Timers should be configured with a period(). If the default one-shot configuration is not
 * desired, the config() can be used to change the timer operational mode.
 *
 * A callback should be registered with the registerCallback() function. When the timer expires,
 * the callback will be invoked. If the timer is configured as a one-shot, the timer will remain
 * expired until start() or restart() is called. If a timer is configured as periodic, the timer
 * will reload the period and re-arm itself.
 *
 * A timer can be restarted (even while running) using the existing period or with a new period.
 *
 * Timers can be stopped while they are running using the stop() function.
 *
 * # Software Timers with embvm::TimerManager<>
 *
 * Timers can be used with the embvm::TimerManager<> class to provide software timer support.
 *
 * @code
 * SimulatorTimer timer;
 * embvm::TimerManager tm(timer);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The embvm::TimerManager will use the timer hardware driver as a master timer, enabling multiple
 * software timers to be created and used while consuming only a single hardware resource.
