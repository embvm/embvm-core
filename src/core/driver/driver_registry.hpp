/** DriverRegistry base class
 *
 * DriverRegistry provides a common DriverRegistry interface that supports
 * both static and dynamic memory allocation styles. Whether dynamic or static memory
 * is used is determined at compile-time by the template arguments.
 *
 * Two convenience definitions are supplied below: `DynamicDriverRegistry` and
 *`StaticDriverRegistry<>` These types should be used to declare DriverRegistry instances for your
 *platform rather than directly using DriverRegistry. They are more expressive and will be
 *easier for readers to understand.
 *
 * Only one DriverRegistry should be defined for each platform & program.
 *
 * @tparam TMaxSize specifies the maximum number of drivers that can be stored.
 *	A value of '0' indicates that dynamic memory should be used.
 * @tparam TReturnSize specifies the maximum number of drivers that can be returned by find_all()
 *	A value of '0' indicates no limit (dynamic memory)
 * @tparam TLockType The type of lock to use with DriverRegistry. Defaults to embutil::nop_lock,
 *	which does not perform any actual locking. If you are using this DriverRegistry in a
 *multi-threaded program and are worried about locking, you can change this to another type such as
 *std::mutex or an interrupt_lock.
