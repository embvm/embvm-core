/** Virtual Hardware Platform Base
 *
 * This class provides the common interfaces and behaviors that virtual hardware platforms
 * must implement. Some functionality is common to all platforms (name functions).
 *
 * Functions whose names are appended with `_` are meant to be supplied by the derived hardware
 * platform:
 *	- earlyInitHook_()
 *	- init_()
 *	- initProcessor_()
 *	- soft_reset_()
 *	- hard_reset_()
 *	- shutdown_()
 *
 * Derived classes may supply additional functions as required. The functions above are the
 * common required functions that all hardware platforms must supply.
 *
 * This class uses the @ref docs/development/patterns/crtp.md ["CRTP pattern"] rather
 * than virtual inheritance. To derive from this class, do the following:
 *	@code
 *	class FWDemoSimulatorHWPlatform : public VirtualHwPlatformBase<FWDemoSimulatorHWPlatform>
 *	{ ... };
 *	@endcode
 *
 * @tparam THWPlatform the derived HW platform implementation (CRTP pattern)
 * @tparam TDriverRegistry The type of the platform's DriverRegistry. DriverRegistry type is
 * 	specified to enable consumers to specify the exact DriverRegistry type/strategy in the
 *	platform layer, since the HW platform doesn't need to know anything about the memory
 *	allocation scheme.
 *	If your platform defines a hw_platform_options.hpp header, then the base class will
 *	automatically pick up your configured registry type.
 *	@code
 *	class UnitTestHWPlatform
 *	: public embvm::VirtualHwPlatformBase<UnitTestHWPlatform>
 *	@endcode
 *  If this header is missing, or you wish to override the platform default for whatever
 *  reason, you can manually specify the type.
 *	@code
 *	class UnitTestHWPlatform
 *	: public embvm::VirtualHwPlatformBase<UnitTestHWPlatform, embvm::DynamicDriverRegistry>
 *	@endcode
 *
 * @ingroup FrameworkHwPlatform
