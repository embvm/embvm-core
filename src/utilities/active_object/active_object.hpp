/* A base class which adds a processing queue and thread to an object.
 *
 * This class represents an object with its own thread of execution. Clients can enqueue
 * operations or events, and they will be processed asynchronously.
 *
 * Use this class as a base class rather than directly managing a thread in an object.
 *
 * # Implementing an Active Object
 *
 * Classes which should have their own thread of control should derive from the activeObject class.
 * The inheritance declaration must include the storage type definition as a template parameter.
 * For example, the aardvarkI2CMaster driver stores a std::pair containing the necessary
 * I2C transaction data (operation struct and callback function).
 *
 * @code
 * class aardvarkI2CMaster final
 *	: public embvm::i2c::master,
 *	  public embutil::activeObject<std::pair<embvm::i2c::op_t, const embvm::i2c::master::cb_t>>
 * {...};
 * @endcode
 *
 * Derived classes must implement the process_() function. This function is used to handle the input
 * data and perform useful processing.
 *
 * # Using an Active Object
 *
 * Operations are added to the op queue through the enqueue() function. Depending on the class
 * and its intended usage, enqueue() can be called directly by client code or within the derived
 * class functions.
 *
 * For example, aardvarkI2CMaster calls enqueue() within the I2C transfer request function
 * (transfer_()).
 *
 * @code
 * embvm::i2c::status aardvarkI2CMaster::transfer_(const embvm::i2c::op_t& op, const
 *embvm::i2c::master::cb_t& cb)
 * {
 * 	enqueue({op, cb});
 *
 * 	return embvm::i2c::status::enqueued;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Enqueued operations are processed on the activeObject thread via the derived classes process_()
 * function. This is where the useful work happens. In the case of aardvarkI2CMaster,
 * aardvarkI2CMaster::process_() parses the operation, talks to the I2C hardware, and returns
 * the result to the caller via the callback function.
 *
 * # process_() Requirements
 *
 * When an element is popped off the queue, this function is called to handle the element
 * processing. The process_() function is implemented by the derived class.
 *
 * process_() takes one parameter: op. This parameter represents the next operation to process
 * on the active object thread.
 *
 * @tparam TDerivedClass The derived class. This is the CRTP pattern.
 * @tparam TStorageType The type of object which can be enqueued for future processing.
 * @tparam TQueueSize When greater than 0 static memory allocation will be used and the queue
 *	will be fixed at the specified size. 0 indicates dynamic memory will be used.
 * @tparam TLock The lock type to use in the activeObject class.
 * @tparam TCond The condition variable type to use in the activeObject class.
 * @ingroup FrameworkUtils
