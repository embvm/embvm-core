/** Base class for dispatch queues
 *
 * This templated base class supports both static and dynamic dispatch queue implementations.
 *
 * This class is not intended to be used directly in a dispatch queue declaration.
 * Instead, use one of the specializations:
 * 	- `DynamicDispatchQueue`
 * 	- `StaticDispatchQueue`
 *
 * # Using a Dispatch Queue
 *
 * Users interact with a dispatch queue using the dispatch() APIs. The dispatch queue can accept
 * any functor: functions, function pointers, lambdas. The client passes a functor to the dispatch()
 * operation, which returns immediately to the client. The functor will be executed asynchronously
 * on the next available dispatch thread.
 *
 * @code
 * static void increment(void)
 * {
 * 	count++;
 * }
 *
 * embutil::DynamicDispatchQueue<> q(num_threads);
 * q.dispatch(count);
 * q.dispatch([] { printf("Hello from a lambda!\n"); });
 * @endcode
 *
 * Dispatch queues are used when an operation needs to run on a separate thread, but you don't want
 * to use explicit thread management. They support asynchronous processing models. A common usage
 * mode is to have the operation call dispatch() to carry out the next step in a processing
 * chain.
 *
 * Dispatch queues cannot be copied or moved.
 *
 * @tparam TSize The size of the storage queue. When TSize is 0, dynamic memory allocation will be
 *	used. Otherwise static memory types are used and the maximum number of operations is limited to
 *	TSize.
 * @tparam TThreadCount The number of threads to use with the dispatch queue.
 * @tparam TFunc The type representing a dispatch function prototype. Defaults to any functor
 *	which can be represented by `void(void)`.
 * @tparam TLock Type to use for the lock. Can be overriden if a custom mutex/lock should be used.
 * @tparam TCond Type to use for the condition variable. Can be overridden if a custom condition
 *	variable implementation should be used.
